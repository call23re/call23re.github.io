There is no ergonomic way to navigate large levels in Roblox Studio. "Flying" from one place to another is slow, and "Zoom to" requires tediously navigating through the explorer. Views solves this problem with a simple, unobtrusive tab-based user interface. It's fast and it's designed to stay out of the way until you need it. It supports team create, and camera saves are easily transferrable between places.

## Reviews
>Simple and clean UI that looks nice and fits in with Studio. Straightforward functionality that does everything you expect it to without issue. Thoughtful shortcuts that make sure it's not in the way of your other tools all of the time, without making it cumbersome and invisible. The execution here is perfect, and even for a functionally simple plugin, having a flawless execution makes this plugin worth every single penny and more. You need this.
